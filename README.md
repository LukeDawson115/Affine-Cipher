Cryptography: Affine Cipher Implementation
This repository is home to a comprehensive C project focused on the implementation of the Affine Cipher, a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher. The project demonstrates both encryption and decryption mechanisms, as well as a brute-force attack method for decrypting ciphertext without prior knowledge of the keys.

Project Overview
The code provides a hands-on approach to understanding the mathematical underpinnings and practical applications of the Affine Cipher in cryptography. Key features of this project include:

Encryption & Decryption: Implements the Affine Cipher to encrypt plaintext and decrypt ciphertext, showcasing the cipher's reliance on modular arithmetic and the importance of key selection.

Brute-Force Decryption: Features a brute-force decryption algorithm that iterates over all possible key combinations, exemplifying how encrypted messages can be cracked without the original keys.

User Interaction: Through a command-line interface, users can choose to encrypt their own messages or decrypt provided ciphertexts, including an option to brute-force decrypt an encrypted message.

Educational Insights: Offers detailed comments and explanations throughout the code, making it an excellent educational tool for students and enthusiasts looking to dive deeper into the world of cryptography.

Technologies
C Programming Language: The entire project is written in C, showcasing efficient use of loops, conditionals, and functions to implement the cryptographic algorithms.
